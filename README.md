# BCloud

Personal cloud system aiming to replace commonly used "Big-Tech" services.
Things like Google Drive, Calendar and so on.

## Development process
The main strategy is to create an MVP and deploy it as early as possible.
Logic is written to support further expansion/development.
The logic is then tested in real world scenarios, fixed and expanded as new needs arise.
Important part for making this more user friendly is that features, where applicable, should be able to import their data from external sources (e.g. Google Drive -> files).
This action is only an "import", and not a "sync" actions, since the aim of the platform is to fully replace the other service, instead of interop with it.
Feature priorities go as follow: extensibility, correctness, functionality, UX, UI
